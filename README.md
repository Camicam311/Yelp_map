# Machine learning and visualization for Yelp-map review Dataset
This is a project/assignment created by and used for [cs61a](https://cs61a.org) from UC Berkeley, and borrowed by [DSC20](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/dsc20-winter-2019/projects/project1-yelp-maps) in UC San Diego. In this project, I implemented core functions in Python regarding data structures, unsupervised and supervised learning, and visualization.

My codes are those between `##Your code starts here` and `##Your code ends here`. **All codes outside the packages `utils`, `abstractions.py`, and `recommend.py` are implemented by stuff from cs61a/DSC20**.
## Algorithms implemented
* All implementation for functions in package `utils` involves techniques including **Higer-order functions**, **List comprehension**, **Lambda expressions**, **Recursions**, and basic data structures.
* All implementation for functions in package `abstractions.py` involves techniques including **Data abstraction**, with the ideas same as **Object-Oriented Programming**.
* All implementation for functions in package `recommend.py` involves techniques including ML Algorithms like **K-Means Clustering** and **Linear Regression**, and with corresponding **Fit and Prediction algorithms**. Other techniques include **Query from database**.
